Dear reader, 

I'm writing this to explain how I solved the given pangramchallenge.
First of all I thought of possible solutions and wrote them down.
Then I broke the steps down on how I wanted the program to work.
In this case I wanted to check every letter if it's there, from a to z.
If it's the case that one or more letters are missing, the program should check from a to z which letters are missing and print them out.
After that I went deeper into detail on how I should write the code then I started coding and doing it simple to avoid errors.
In the end I tested the code on Windows 10 and Linuxmint.
