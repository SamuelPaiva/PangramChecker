# PangramChecker

This is a program written in Python to check if a sentence is a pangram or not.
In case the sentence contains all the letters of the alphabet, the program tells you that it is an pangram.
If the sentence does not contain all the letters of the alphabet, the program tells you so and displays all the missing letters.

Such as:

or

## Installation

#### Requirements

This is a really simple program so it should work fine on every operating system.
The program was tested on Windows and Linux.

To use the program on your Windows os follow these steps:

1. Download the zipfile using this button:

2. Save the file in any directory you like. 
As you can see in the first two pictures, I've saved my files in a directory called "Challenge", which is located on my Desktop, so it's easy for me to run the file with the comand line, which I'll explain in the next step.
